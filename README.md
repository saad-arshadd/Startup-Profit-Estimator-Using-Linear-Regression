# Startup-Profit-Estimator-Using-Linear-Regression
## Project Overview

**ProfitPredictor** is a machine learning model designed to estimate the potential profits of startup companies based on their financial data. The model uses a **Linear Regression** algorithm to predict profits based on features like **R&D Spend**, **Administration**, and **Marketing Spend**. This project is useful for investors, entrepreneurs, and business analysts looking to estimate the profit potential of new startups based on financial inputs.

## Features

- **Profit Prediction**: Predict the profit of a startup using input features like R&D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend.
- **Linear Regression Model**: A simple yet powerful model to predict the profit based on financial data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared to measure prediction accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Includes data visualization to explore relationships between input features and the predicted profit.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing the Linear Regression model
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProfitPredictor.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ProfitPredictor
    ```

3. Install the necessary Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Use

1. **Load the Dataset**: The dataset contains financial data of startups including features like R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and Profit.
   
2. **Train the Model**: Use **Linear Regression** to train the model on the dataset. The model will learn the relationship between the features and the profit.

3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict the profit for a new startup based on its financial inputs.

4. **Evaluate the Model**: The model's accuracy is evaluated using the **R-squared** value, which helps understand how well the model's predictions match the actual profits.

### Example Usage

```python
# Sample Input: [R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend]
new_startup = np.array([[165349.2, 12136897.80000, 471784.1]])
predicted_profit = regressor.predict(new_startup)
print("Predicted Profit for new startup:", predicted_profit[0])
